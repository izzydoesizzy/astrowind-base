When you say \'expensive,\' are you comparing us to another solution, or to the cost of keeping things as they are?\n\nLet me share something: [Customer Name] had the same reaction, but after seeing [specific outcome—e.g., 40% reduction in onboarding time], they realized the ROI was actually 3x their investment in the first year.\n\nWhat would need to be true for this investment to feel like a no-brainer for you?"'

We can sometimes adjust structure or terms, but the investment is tied to the outcomes we commit to delivering.\n\nCan we walk through what success would look like for you so we can see together what makes sense? Sometimes there are ways to structure this that work better for your situation.\n\nWhat specific outcome would make this investment feel worth it to you?"'

Is it the fit, the investment, the timing, or something else?\n\nI ask because sometimes when people say \'think about it,\' there\'s a specific concern we haven\'t addressed yet. If we can solve that concern now, would that help you move forward?\n\nAlso, what happens if you wait? What\'s the cost of not solving [the problem] in the next [timeframe]?"'

Before we park it, can we quickly look at what changes—good or bad—if we revisit this in six months instead of now?\n\nFor example, [Customer Name] was in a similar situation. They waited six months, and by then [specific negative consequence—e.g., they\'d lost 3 key team members to competitors, or the problem had cost them $X].\n\nWhat would need to be different in six months for this to make sense then? And what\'s the cost if nothing changes?"'

    script: '"That makes sense—nobody wants to overload the team. Can I ask what project you\'re working on?\n\nSometimes what we do actually supports other initiatives. For example, [Customer Name] was in the middle of [similar project] and found that our solution actually accelerated their timeline.\n\nIf this did move forward, what would we need to do to make sure it feels supportive, not overwhelming? Could we phase it in a way that works with your current project?"'

    script: '"Thank you for sharing that—that context really helps. Can you tell me a bit about what you tried before and what specifically didn\'t work?\n\nWas it the product itself, the implementation, the support, or something else?\n\nI ask because while we might seem similar on the surface, we actually approach [key differentiator] very differently. For example, [Customer Name] had the same experience with [competitor/similar solution], but here\'s what made the difference with us: [specific differentiator].\n\nDoes that address the concern you had before?"'

    script: '"I hear that. Can you help me understand what feels complex? Is it the setup, the day-to-day use, or something else?\n\nThe good news is that while we\'re powerful, we\'re actually designed to be simple. Most of our customers say it\'s easier than what they were using before.\n\nFor example, [Customer Name] had the same concern, but after [specific training/support], their team was up and running in [timeframe]. We also provide [specific support—e.g., dedicated onboarding, training, ongoing support].\n\nWhat would make you feel confident that your team could use this successfully?"'

For example, [Customer Name] needed [similar customization] and here\'s how we handled it: [solution].\n\nSometimes when people say \'customizable,\' they\'re really concerned about [underlying need]. Is that what you\'re thinking about, or something else?\n\nWhat would need to be customizable for this to work perfectly for you?"'

Can you help me understand who else needs to be part of this decision?\n\nAnd what do you think their main concerns or questions will be? I ask because I can help you prepare for that conversation, or I\'m happy to join a call with them if that would be helpful.\n\nWhat information would be most helpful for them to see? I can put together a brief summary or proposal that addresses their likely concerns."'

Even if you\'re not the final decision maker, your input is really valuable.\n\nWhat would need to be true for you to feel confident recommending this to [decision maker]? I\'d love to help you become a champion for this.\n\nAlso, would it be helpful if I had a conversation with [decision maker] directly?

Can I ask what you like about what you\'ve seen from them so far?\n\nI ask because while we might seem similar, we actually approach [key differentiator] very differently. For example, [specific differentiator that matters to them].\n\n[Competitor Name] is great at [their strength], but where we really shine is [your unique strength that addresses their specific need].\n\nWhat\'s most important to you in making this decision?

    script: '"I totally respect that—building in-house gives you full control. Can I ask what\'s driving that decision? Is it about customization, cost, or something else?\n\nI ask because we\'ve worked with several companies who started down that path. For example, [Customer Name] was building something similar, but after [timeframe], they realized it was taking [X times longer] and costing [Y times more] than expected.\n\nBy the time they came to us, they\'d spent [resources] and still weren\'t where they wanted to be. They ended up using our solution and were live in [timeframe] instead of [their timeline].\n\nWhat would need to be true for buying to make more sense than building?"'
