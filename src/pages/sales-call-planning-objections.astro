When you say \'expensive,\' are you comparing this to other coaches you\'ve looked at, or to what it costs to stay where you are right now?\n\nLet me share something: [Client Name] had the same reaction, but after [specific transformation—e.g., landing their dream role, doubling their revenue, finally launching their business], they said the investment paid for itself in the first three months.\n\nWhat would need to be true for this investment to feel like a no-brainer for you?"',

Before we park this, can we quickly look at what changes if we revisit this in a few months?\n\nFor example, [Client Name] was in a similar situation.

What matters most to you?\n\nI ask because while there are great coaches out there, we all have different strengths.
